# HackHarvard Global Hackathon 2018

### A Cantonese language detection/sentiment analysis tool

> In Hong Kong, the percentage of solo dwellers has risen from 11.6 % in 2006 to 13.6% in 2016. Including the situation that living with a spouse, the percentage has risen from 32.8% in 2016 to 38.3%

The chat App with emotion analyzing function built to help the local elderly with mental health.

Our team, Local One, has focused on the life quality of the elderly in Hong Kong. The situation of the elderly is usually not noticed by the majority. We would like to investigate the group and find out any problems that we could help. Limited by time and ability, the scope of the investigation is limited in Hong Kong, the living city of all team members. Unsurprisingly,  we have found several problems arose among those people. After sincere consideration, we have chosen the emotional issues as the team's topic.
